Translation: **The Legendary Zoltan**

### When did planning for SO3 begin?

> **Gotanda:** While we were still making The Second Story. During the debugging phase a bunch of us would go to a restaurant and talk about what we're going to put in Star Ocean 3. And before we knew it, it would be morning.

### Why did you replace the voice collection with the battle trophy collection?

> **Gotanda:** It wasn't that we wanted to replace it. We just didn't want to do the same thing as before. Also, we didn't have enough disc space because there are a lot of voices. Don't worry. I'm sure someone will eventually copy the voice collection idea.
> 
> **Kojima:** A lot of players said the voice collection was really hard. But the hardcore players said they wanted MORE voices.
> 
> **Ogawa:** The battle trophies are designed so that no one will have all of the trophies by the end of the game. Some require a second playthrough and some are just really hard to get. But if you look at the way the trophies are ordered, it's actually possible to guess what the unobtained trophies are. We made the trophies this way in hopes that people would enjoy figuring them out on their own. Do your best, players!

### What was the design philosophy behind the battle trophies?

> **Gotanda:** Basically we put trophies that players would be able to come up with themselves as they play the game. But there are some we added out of impulse or momentum. A good example is number 291, (I think he means number 295) "hit an enemy with a battle sphere 5 times."
> 
> **Ogawa:** We put that one in because we had planned to make battle spheres much more easily accessible. But due to issues with the placement of items throughout the world, they ended up being very hard to get.

### What do you like about the new Private Action (PA) system?

> **Gotanda:** We wanted to show how characters' feelings change over time in a natural way through casual conversation. In SO2 you had to initiate PAs with a button-press. This time it flows more naturally. We've been thinking about this forever. I think there were plans for this type of system in the SO2 planning documents.

### It sounds like you've gotten closer to your ideal system now.

> **Ogawa:** The system is closer to ideal but I wouldn't say I'm satisfied. I wanted to put a lot more conversations in there.

### It's been six months since release. Is there anything you wish you could put in the game right now?

> **Gotanda:** If I had infinite time, I'd probably just remake the entire game from scratch.
> 
> **Ogawa:** There are several things I wish I had done now. One example is your mode of transportation on Elicoor II. You have to walk everywhere, and you spend a lot of time traveling. So I really wish I had put in other means of getting around. I had some ideas for it, but none of them felt right to me. So I didn't use any of them.

# THEME: LINEAGE

### The language of Elicoor II looks like the ancient letters on the Planet Styx. Why is that?

> **Gotanda:** Originally only demi-humans lived on Elicoor II. When the original planet Nede was crumbling away, some people escaped the planet in a ship that can travel through time and space. They arrived on Elicoor II and brought their writings with them. Eventually the Kingdom of Aquaria was born from this.

### And they landed on Elicoor 3.7 billion years before the destruction of Nede?

> **Gotanda:** We never decided precisely when, but they went to Elicoor a few billion years AFTER the destruction of Nede. The reason it took them so long is because their technology for traveling through time-space wasn't perfected and thus, there were many accidents. So the people aboard the ship put themselves in cryostasis and slept until the tech was developed.

### Is this method of traveling through space-time the same system that was used to transport Rena from Energy Nede to Expel?

> **Gotanda:** Rena lived in a different era, but it's pretty much the same. Refugees from Nede arrived on planets other than Elicoor as well. This all happened billions of years ago.

### Does this mean that the current generation of people on Elicoor are descendants of Nedians?

> **Gotanda:** That's right. Because among those people that arrived from Nede were some special technique users. (Translator’s note: I’m not sure what he means here. It said there were jutsushi among those people. It literally just means people who can use the technique or skill. Maybe they meant people who developed the time-space travel technology?). If you want to know just how long the bloodline has endured, check the book of lineages in Aquaria Castle.

### Now that you mention it, they used healing magic as medical treatment, didn't they? But there is no healing magic in symbology.

> **Gotanda:** Yes, the doctor in Ameena's event used it for example. But healing magic that can save a life is really complicated, not everyone can use it. Remember, only direct descendants of Nedians can use healing magic. Expelians such as Celine and Leon can't.

### Moving on. It's established in the opening that there is a conflict going on that is dividing space into three factions. Can you tell me about the distribution of the power in the galaxy?

> **Gotanda:** There are the Galactic Federation and the Aldion Empire acting as the two main powers in the galaxy. For the longest time, Aldion had never had any diplomatic relations with any other nations. The Federation and Aldion have been at war for over 60 years. Compared to them, Vendeen is a weak tiny nation. But they have very advanced technology. Both the Federation and Aldion want to recruit Vendeen to their side. But thanks to their technology, they were able to maintain neutrality. Of course, the Vendeeni think they are the strongest in the galaxy.

### It seems like Aldion has a very large sphere of influence.

> **Gotanda:** They don't appear in the game but they are set as being a massive force. They are the only force that could ever go up against the Federation. But then they were annihilated by the executioners like they were nothing. So you might think they weren't a big deal. But they were an absolutely huge faction.

### The high-tech Vendeeni are established as knowing about the existence of 4D beings. Did they reach that conclusion on their own?

> **Ogawa:** Maybe. I don't think they know of any specific people being 4D. You know, in this world exists something akin to god, and the Vendeeni know that those god-like beings are threatening us. But they don't know that there is a place called 4D Space with 4D beings that are manipulating us.

### So what do the Vendeeni hope to accomplish by capturing Fayt?

> **Ogawa:** They know that Fayt has some kind of power that can rival these god-like beings. And they don't know what'll happen to them if the Federation acquires that power. So they want to take it for themselves.
> 
> **Gotanda:** The Vendeeni don't know that Fayt himself is the weapon. So they kidnapped Dr. Leingod as well.

### Sophia was captured too. Did they know that she has a power, too?

> **Ogawa:** I don't think so. But they probably just assumed that she did based on the fragments of information they had on Fayt. The Vendeeni never wait for conclusive evidence before they make decisions.

*"A person can become a god just by creating an encapsulated world."*

### What kind of world is 4D space?

> **Gotanda:** They don't have 27th century-level development. If we compare our real life technology to that of 4D space, I'd say we are just moderately inferior in certain areas.

### I see. The weapons the 4D security service used weren't really all that advanced either. They were kind of sloppy too.

> **Gotanda:** The point of that battle was to let down the player by making them think, "Is this the only kind of weapon I'll be attacked with in 4D?" That's how I hoped players would feel, so that's why that fight is like that.

### So where does the 4D world excel?

> **Gotanda:** Computer technology. They have the ability to fully simulate a world with inhabitants that believe it's real. Of course those people inside the simulation would view people with the ability to create such worlds as gods. So all it takes to be a god is the ability to create the simulation and that's it.

### In other words, anyone who specializes in that kind of programming?

> **Gotanda:** Right. I don't believe that being a god means that nothing can hurt you. If you can create a world that's closed off from other worlds, you can become a god. The game is implying that if gods exist they are simply beings that have a power we cannot obtain. This is the original theme for 4D space.

### Is the 4D world itself based on anything?

> **Gotanda:** I thought of it as a world that would be boring to live in yet full of decadence and degeneracy. My concept for 4D people is that they too are programmed or manipulated by a higher existence. Probably by 5D beings. (Laughs)

### And this game that was created by 4D beings, the Eternal Sphere. . . What kind of game is it?

> **Gotanda:** It's not actually a game. It's treated like an online game to make it easy to understand, but it's really a world simulator. You can only watch it. You can make a character, but you can't control it. That may seem different to how it's portrayed in the game, but that was the intended concept since phase 1.

### So then what exactly are you seeing when you watch the Eternal Sphere?

> **Gotanda:** You're watching the things that are happening now in real time and also past events. You can view past events that have happened at any time or place. That's what makes these people 4D. Space + time. We can't travel through time, but they can. Although they can't alter what transpired in the past.

### The events that are happening in real time can only be watched?

> **Gotanda:** The Eternal Sphere is basically built just to be watched, but over the course of time new plug-ins are installed. For example, a nuclear weapon plug-in! (Laughs) When that happens, somebody somewhere in the world develops a new technology and that technology becomes a foothold for an entire civilization to become one step more advanced. In the real world new technology is not being developed in a single place. In far away places there are people researching the same thing at the same time, and the one that manages to put everything together first gets to announce it to the world. Now, how could two completely unrelated people researching the exact same thing be a coincidence? It's not. It's because a new plug-in was installed. That's how I like to think about it. This idea was one of the foundations upon which the Eternal Sphere was created.

### Why do you say there are multiple timelines in Star Ocean?

> **Gotanda:** It comes from a recent theory in space science that says there are multiple universes, and that ours is just one of many. It's the same as the theory that the 3D universe, which was created by 4D beings, is just one of many universes. It's the same as there being a parallel dimension running alongside our real-life galaxy and timeline. To say it another way, time is marching on from all points in time simultaneously. Thus, we use the phrase, "multiple timelines." Of course, there is no way to leave this universe to confirm there are others.

# THEME: STORY

### SO3's story is like the final chapter in the series. Was this your intention when you were making Star Ocean 1?

> **Gotanda:** I'm only ever thinking about the game I'm currently working on. (Laughs) My intent with this game was to end the Star Ocean series. That's why I wanted to implement the idea of there being a 4D world beyond our world. If I use this plot device, that's the end of the story no matter what, right?
> 
> **Ogawa:** There were a lot of players who found the story shocking.
> 
> **Gotanda:** The idea of a setting like 4D space has been used in science fiction so much that I honestly couldn't believe that was their opinion. The whole time I was worried that people would think the trope is boring for being too commonplace. The reaction makes me think that players just didn't have a lot of experience with sci-fi. Maybe this setting was a little hard to understand for people who don't read sci-fi novels.
> 
> **Ogawa:** Also, the idea that the entire world and everything that happened in it up to that point was virtual reality shocked a lot of players.
> 
> **Gotanda:** I think most of the shocked players weren't shocked for any specific reason. They were just shocked instinctually. Like they were just betrayed. But the real world is just like a game. There's no guarantee that this world wasn't made by somebody else, is there? If players think about things in this way, then it will actually be very easy for them to accept the story.

### How do 4D beings view the existence of Fayt?

> **Ogawa:** He's the real-life manifestation of data they created, so I think they're terrified of what the ramifications could be. Now, you could say that since he's data, all you have to do is delete him. But it's not that simple, because within that data, intelligence has developed. So now there's a question of whether or not it's even OK to delete him. Blair is a moderate who respects this newly born intelligence. That's not the case with Luther (Translator's note: In the Japanese version, his name is Lucifer)

# World and Setting Rapid Fire Q&A

**Q:** Is it true that the codename for Star Ocean 1 was "The Eternal Sphere"?

**A:** Yes. And every single staff member at the time said the name was too difficult to understand. So we discarded it.

**Q:** How many people are in the entire galaxy?

**A:** There are 12 billion people in the Klaus system alone. So I'd say tens of trillions.

**Q:** What kind of organization is Quark?

**A:** It's an anti-federation group composed mainly of Klausians. It has thousands of members. The group is largely unknown, but it's becoming ever more important for a certain muscle-man.

**Q:** What organization oversees the Underdeveloped Planet Preservation Pact?

**A:** Since it's a law related to soldiers, the Federation is in charge of it. Although it is often broken, it is so important that it has become the first article in Federation law.

**Q:** What happens if you break the UP3?

**A:** It's a crime that's considered as heavy as murder. So unless you had no other choice you'll be sentenced to death. Or you may be banished to Eternity Space.

**Q:** Are the time gates in SO1 and SO3 the same time gate?

**A:** Yes. Originally, the time gate was governed by A.I. But in SO3, Sophia was able to use her power of Connection and open the gate to 4D space before the A.I. program could stop her.

**Q:** What happened to Earth when it was hit by an Executioner's attack?

**A:** It remains completely intact. We may have exaggerated in the FMV, but Earth did not get deleted. The movie that we ordered was entitled "The Destruction of Earth". Looks like someone went a little crazy with the title there.

**Q:** What happens to Sphere Company?

**A:** Luther dies and Blair does something with the company.

**Q:** Where did Albel meet Romero?

**A:** Albel sent a scouting team to some ruins, but when they didn't return, he decided to go search the ruins himself. Romero is an intelligent undead. The ending doesn't show the battle but, of course, Albel is not as strong as Luther.

<sub>*(Translator's note: This is referring to Albel's ending. I don't know why Gotanda references Luther here. Is he saying that the character Romero is Luther?)*</sub>

*End of Side Panel*

* * *

### Why did Luther want to delete Fayt?

> **Gotanda:** Cause he's the last boss. (Laughs) That was a joke, but if something unexpected pops up, you've got to deal with it somehow, right? Luther's method may have been a little excessive, but I think his reaction was normal. All he did was try to delete it using anti-virus software such as the Convictors and the Executioners. Fayt destroys them one after another and then jumps out of your computer screen. You'd be really surprised too. Luther kept on trying to erase the bug (Fayt), and in the end, the bug decided to come after Luther. That's when he decided to just format the entire Eternal Sphere.

*"I wish I could connect our brains with an electrode* *so you can understand what I'm thinking."*

### Now that you mention it, Luther wasn't actually a bad guy, was he?

> **Gotanda:** He created that world. So he is its god. And he believes that he should be able to do whatever he wants with it. But to the greatest people within his world, Luther looks like a god that has gone insane.

### In short, they have different viewpoints, right?

> **Gotanda:** Star Ocean 1 was the same way. If you remain calm and really think about it, you were the bad guys. That's what I was trying to communicate to the players. We could say the same thing that happened in that game is happening in real life. For example, destruction of the environment. We're destroying the environment more and more day by day, and everybody knows that it's bad. Then one day something inside a person's heart suddenly clicks, and he starts telling everyone, "We have to stop destroying the environment." But he's been destroying the environment all this time, the same as everyone else.

### Is there a reason you made the last boss a game company?

> **Gotanda:** I don't consider the Eternal Sphere a game. I didn't really have an image of what kind of company Sphere is. I guess you could think of it as a game company though.

### But that would make you the new Luther!

> **Gotanda:** (Laughs)

### What are we supposed to think about the ending?

> **Gotanda:** There are no words in any human language that I can use to answer that question. It's something like, "Why were humans born into this world?" or "Why do humans exist?" I wish I could connect our brains with an electrode so you can understand what I'm thinking. Whether or not the world still exists after the ending, I leave to your imagination.

# THEME: UNPUBLISHED INFORMATION

### SO3 has the smallest number of characters in the series. Was that the plan from the beginning?

> **Ogawa:** We were going to have the inventor Izak join the party. Maria uses beam guns, so we were going to have Izak use machine guns or some modern weapon that has live ammunition. But he doesn't talk much, so we never came up with any story events for him.

### Did you have an ending in mind for him?

> **Ogawa:** Just a concept. (Laughs) We imagined it being like Raputa, where there's a robot and a young girl. Izak puts the girl on a spaceship and Izak himself is an essential part of the ship's computer. But we decided not to include him pretty early on. So we don't have any partially-completed work for him.

### Are there any other characters you wanted to add to the party?

> **Ogawa:** We thought about Mirage, but not as a full-on character. Just as a character you can use in a bonus dungeon or something like that. (Translator's note: The original version that was released in Japan did not have Mirage or Adray as playable characters. They were later added into a version called Director's Cut, which is the version that was released in America.)
> 
> **Gotanda:** Mirage can't join you in the beginning of the game because she's constantly helping you from outside. I never told anyone to make an ending for Mirage, but she's involved in the story from the beginning until the end. So she ended up getting an ending just naturally.

### What kind of character did you plan to make Mirage?

> Ogawa: Cliff mostly punches stuff, so we were gonna make Mirage kick stuff. Thinking about it now, she probably would have been better balanced and stronger than Cliff.

### I'd like to inquire about a rumor that's been going around about the mysterious character, Elena Frahm. To be as direct as possible, who is she?

> **Gotanda:** She is exactly what the rumors say she is, a 4D being. And she was one of the developers of the Eternal Sphere. There's a message in the game that says that during development there was an accident that transferred her spirit into the Eternal Sphere.

### What happens when your spirit is trapped in the Eternal Sphere?

> **Gotanda:** Her spirit is removed from her body. So in the 4D world she is a vegetable. Her spirit in the Eternal Sphere retains all knowledge and self awareness. Her appearance was set to her preference when her spirit was transferred.

### I guess it was easy for her to invent something like the Thunder Arrow with her retained knowledge.

> **Gotanda:** She's not trying to use her advanced knowledge to invent or discover anything.

### So how did she become head researcher at the castle?

> **Gotanda:** From the view of Elicoorians, she is a person who casually lets Nobel Prize-level discoveries slip from her lips. Because of her accomplishments in real life, she rose to such a position but she did so reluctantly. She doesn't actually want to invent things. Making a symbological weapon wasn't Elena's idea. It started with Dio and Mackwell. But an idea like that has a lot of dangerous elements that could cause a huge accident. So she added a bunch of safety features to the blueprints, and now no one other than her can fully understand its construction. (Laughs)

### By the way, there are books in Elena's room with Symbological symbols written in them. Can Elena read sentences written in symbols? *<sub>(Translator's note: I'm not entirely sure if they mean Symbology or Heraldry here. Looking on the Japanese Wikipedia articles for both games, it refers to the magic that Celine (SO2), Sophia (SO3), and Nel (SO3) can use all as 紋章術(monshou jutsu). I will be translating this word as Symbology. Let me know if you find any discrepancies with that translation.)</sub>*

> **Ogawa:** She's 4D, so of course she can. She can read it more easily than she can read Elicoor's language. She has a deep grasp of it.

### Can we assume that it was Elena who supplied Ruddle and Rumina with all the latest armor and weapons at the endgame?

> **Ogawa:** That's right. Even with the materials available to her on an underdeveloped planet, she can make anything within the bounds of her knowledge.

### Let's leave the topic of what Elena knows and move on to what she has been doing until now. She was dating Arzei (the king of Airyglyph) for a while. Did she ever reciprocate Arzei's feelings? How did they meet?

> **Ogawa:** Yes. They were dating a long time ago. Elena had already given up trying to escape the Eternal Sphere. So she vowed to find love in this world. When a genius girl (Elena) suddenly appeared in Aquaria Castle, the new exchange student that everyone was talking about (Arzei) decided to strike up a conversation with her.

### Does Elena age? Can she die from disease?

> **Gotanda:** No and no.

### I want to ask you about Nel's ending. Does Nel know Elena's true form?

> **Ogawa:** Not to the point where she can say, "YOU! YOU'RE 4D!" But Nel saw the 4D world with Fayt, so she definitely doesn't look at Elena the same as she did at the beginning of the game.

*"Keep using your imagination while you look forward to the next game."*

### Do you have a message for the Star Ocean fans?

> **Gotanda:** As far as I'm concerned, Star Ocean is finished.
> 
> **Kojima:** I can say that if fans communicate their passion, there is a good chance Star Ocean can come back. I'm sure that President Gotanda feels the same way. (Laughs)
> 
> **Gotanda:** Yeah. (Uncomfortable laugh)

### If we take the first letter of each line in the prophetic scriptures and decipher the code, it will tell us the next game you're working on. And that is. . . ?

> **Ogawa:** It's a secret. (Laughs) It might be a new Star Ocean. It might be a new Valkyrie Profile. It could be anything.

### So you are in fact working on the next game already?

> **Gotanda:** Maybe. I don't know. (Laughs) I personally would like to make an original new game. Again I'd like to make a game that we at tri-Ace will enjoy playing. I hope you will like it too.
